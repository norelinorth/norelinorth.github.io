**Noreli North** — AI agents & automation, with resources you can actually use.

I turn ideas into **working AI automations** — because AI agents turn routine work into shipped outcomes: faster cycles, fewer errors, more leverage. Here you’ll learn to build AI agents end-to-end: connect real tools (APIs, files, apps), add safety checks, iterate quickly, and **deploy with confidence**. Most demos are general; some use **finance workflows** (accruals, reconciliations, variance) to teach techniques you can reuse anywhere.

### What you’ll get
- Short, focused videos (no fluff)
- Practical resources: starter kits & templates
- General examples + finance use cases (transferable techniques)
- Clear builds: tool contracts, review steps, and deploy guides

### Start here
- Minimal agent in 5 minutes *(first post)*
- Safety checks & preview before changes *(technique)*
- Deploy with one YAML *(how‑to)*
